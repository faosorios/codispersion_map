# Codispersion Map for Rectangular Grids

The codispersion coefficient quantifies the association between two spatial processes for a particular direction (spatial lag) on the two-dimensional space. The R function **hcodisp.map** provides a graphical tool called codispersion map to visualize the spatial correlation between two sequences measured for regular lattices on the plane.
